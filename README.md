A powerful Chrome extension that enhances the Fooocus web UI experience by adding useful features and improvements.

## Why was...

The extension is designed to provide a simple solution for saving trigger words for lora models.
I made it primarily for my own use, but I also looked at the project more during development.

## Roadmap

- [x]  Save, edit and paste trigger words from downloaded lora models to the positive prompt.
- [x]  VueJS for easier template management (or some good solution).
- [ ]  Export settings options.
- [ ]  CivitAI profile integration.
- [ ]  Download models from CivitAI.
- [ ]  Refactoring and everything else.

## Known bugs

- When loading, the basic lora trigger words container is not displayed.
- If you select a preset, the container of the associated trigger words is not displayed by default, you have to select it again.
